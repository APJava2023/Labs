This screen protector saved my iPhone screen! I’m a full-time DoorDasher and Instacart shopper so I use my phone almost non-stop throughout the day. Having a good case and screen protector is essential for me to be able to do my job without worrying about a damaged phone from a simple drop on the pavement or into slush/snow etc. I dropped my phone screen first from about chest height the other day and it did a pretty good number on the screen protector (see pics). But my phone screen didn’t have a knick on it. They come in packs if 3 so I just threw another one on the next day and it was like it never happened. This screen protector served its purpose well. I would purchase again and would highly recommend.
